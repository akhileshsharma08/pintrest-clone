        <p>
          Pinterest is a visual discovery engine for finding ideas like recipes,
          home and style inspiration, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          With billions of Pins on Pinterest, you'll always find ideas to spark
          inspiration. When you discover Pins you love, save them to boards to
          keep your ideas organised and easy to find. You can also create Pins
          to share your ideas with other people on Pinterest.
